		 * Note that on most versions of most BSDs (including Mac OS X) select() and poll() do not work correctly on BPF devices; a file descriptor on most of those versions (the exceptions being FreeBSD 4.3 and 4.4), a simple select() or poll() will not return even after the read timeout expires. To work around this, an application that uses select() or poll() to wait for packets to arrive must put the {@link Capture} in non-blocking mode, and must arrange that the select() or poll() have a timeout less than or equal to the read timeout, and must try to read packets after that timeout expires, regardless of whether select() or poll() indicated that the file descriptor is ready to be read or not. (That workaround will not work in FreeBSD 4.3 and later; however, in FreeBSD 4.6 and later, select() and poll() work correctly on BPF devices, so the workaround isn't necessary, although it does no harm.)
		 *
		 * Note also that poll() doesn't work on character special files, including BPF devices, in Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5, so, while select() can be used on the descriptor, poll() cannot be used on it those versions of Mac OS X. Kqueues also don't work on that descriptor. poll(), but not kqueues, work on that descriptor in Mac OS X releases prior to 10.4; poll() and kqueues work on that descriptor in Mac OS X 10.6 and later.
